<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Abdullah Mohammed Al-Maliki, I am 31 years old.
I graduated from the diploma stage from the Faculty of Society with a rate of 3.46 out of 4.
 My specialization was computer science.
 At this rate, I was able to complete the bachelor's stage at Umm Al-Qura University, Faculty of Computer and Information Systems, and I graduated with an average of 2.66 out of 4.
 My graduation project from the bus ticket booking system and its results were beautiful, but it was not completed to the last stage due to the lack of time in that period.
 However, I benefited from my experience with my colleagues and learned from my mistakes in my graduation project.
 Unfortunately, I did not have cooperative training at that time, but I learned from my studies at the university and gained multiple skills, including teamwork and overcoming the pressures of the university and accomplishing tasks accurately and on time.</p>

<p>My strength skills are communication skills and the ability to solve problems and adapt to the work environment.</p>

<p>My most prominent hobbies, I love reading and learning everything new, and I also love football and video games. As for my most prominent interests, I am very interested in space science.</p>
